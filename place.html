        <p>My favorite place is my home. Reason #1, it is my home, and as such I don't have to get used to being there. Reason #2, there aren't many people there. Reason #3, all of my video games are there. Lastly, reason #4, I can lay down and sleep there! There isn't any reason to not like being home, and I generally would rather not be anywhere else. Seriously, I really don't like being in public at all, because I might have to socialize with people I don't know.</p>
