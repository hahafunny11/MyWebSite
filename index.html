        <h2>Memes</h2>
        <p>I have a soft spot for memes. They can be funny, they can be dumb and stupid, and they can be dark. Yet, I still love them. One of my favorite memes is this video of a scarecrow puppet doing a weird dance. I replace the music of the original video with pretty much any other song, and it is funny. The comedy increases tenfold when the music is perfectly in beat, as well as when the music is EXTREMELY unfitting (For example, something that is extremely ominous and/or forboding). </p><br>
        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>I also have a soft spot for video games. The best part about video games is that they are interactive. I can actually do things in the game! There are also many types of video games, including rhythm, roguelike, RPG (eastern and western), action-adventure, horror, etc. There's too many to count! Some of my favorite video games include, but are not limited to: Celeste, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, and Slime Rancher.</p>
